    <h1>What is Frontend Development?</h1>
    <p>Front-end web development, is known as client-side development, Front-end developers are responsible for the visual aspects of a website. They also create the site&#39s interactive features and functionality, such as menus, drop-downs, sliders, the contact forms, search boxes, and other features that allow users to interact with the site. The programming languages that a front-end developer uses, can create a static webpage or a dynamic one.</p>
    
    <p>I chose Frontend development because it satisfies my need for creativity and it enables me put my ideas in digital form.</p>
